OpenSea clone NFT marketplace for Aurora EVM implemented on the NEAR Blockchain

##How this works
The NFT Marketplace as a decentralized Web3 application built over a javascript software stack using EVM-based backend software, tools, and specification but for a non-EVM protocol platform i.e. NEAR using Aurora EVM and its currency.

This enables users to list their NFTs on the NEAR platform and get benefits of lower gas charges and the benefit of a non-EVM blockchain protocol and platform. Here NFTs trading like directly sells, auction, lists, unlisting, etc. is feasible.


##Smart Contract Addresses
Change the address(in the src/config/contractAddress.js) if you deploy the factoryContract and marketPlace freshly using the Hardhat CLI
exports.factoryContractAddress = "0xf5351DFC815b83289d1b4aDeC5c6A423eb523729";
exports.nftMarketplaceAddress = "0x2b82bedAaB3C8dCD16b71a5cc7AB119Afa6D7D2C";
